# Server side template injection (SSTI)

## [Basic server-side template injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection/exploiting/lab-server-side-template-injection-basic)

This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the unsafe construction of an ERB template.

To solve the lab, review the ERB documentation to find out how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

## [Basic server-side template injection (code context)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection/exploiting/lab-server-side-template-injection-basic-code-context)

This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection due to the way it unsafely uses a Tornado template. To solve the lab, review the Tornado documentation to discover how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

## [Server-side template injection using documentation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection/exploiting/lab-server-side-template-injection-using-documentation)

This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection. To solve the lab, identify the template engine and use the documentation to work out how to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.

## [Server-side template injection in an unknown language with a documented exploit](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection/exploiting/lab-server-side-template-injection-in-an-unknown-language-with-a-documented-exploit)

This lab is vulnerable to server-side template injection. To solve the lab, identify the template engine and find a documented exploit online that you can use to execute arbitrary code, then delete the morale.txt file from Carlos's home directory.
