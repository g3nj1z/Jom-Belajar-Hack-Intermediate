# OS command injection

## [Blind OS command injection with output redirection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-output-redirection)

This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response. However, you can use output redirection to capture the output from the command. There is a writable folder at:
/var/www/images/

The application serves the images for the product catalog from this location. You can redirect the output from the injected command to a file in this folder, and then use the image loading URL to retrieve the contents of the file.

To solve the lab, execute the whoami command and retrieve the output. 

## [Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-out-of-band)

 This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to issue a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator. 

## [Blind OS command injection with out-of-band data exfiltration](https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection/lab-blind-out-of-band-data-exfiltration)

This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, execute the whoami command and exfiltrate the output via a DNS query to Burp Collaborator. You will need to enter the name of the current user to complete the lab.
